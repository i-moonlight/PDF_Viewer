# angular-pdf-viewer
Just another Angular directive for displaying PDF files using PDF.js

[Live demo](http://jdryg.github.io/angular-pdf-viewer)

#### Features
- Continuous view (all pages are inserted into the DOM when the PDF is loaded)
- Lazy page rendering (render a page only when it enters the viewport for the first time).
- Text layer (currently added by default, will be optional in a future version)
- Zoom to
 * Value
 * Fit the width of the widest page
 * Fit the height of 1st page

#### Directive attributes
- src: (input) URL to the PDF file
- initial-scale: (input) The initial zoom level of the document. Either "fit_width", "fit_height" or a floating point value.
- progress-callback: (input) A function which will be called everytime something changes (e.g. download progress, page rendering progress or errors from those operations).
- api: (output) An object with several functions you can use to communicate with the directive.

See partials/demo.html for details on the directive syntax and js/controllers.js for details on how to use the directive API and the progress callback.

#### TODO
- Jump to page
- Password protected PDFs
- Search (this isn't actually related to the directive but it would be nice for the example).
